## 1.Bash

Learned the basic of  Bash Scripting. Never knew that automating commands would be useful.
Peope actually use commmands like pwgen to generate passwords for them as generating one online would create security concerns. The OS uses /dev/urandom and /dev/random to generate sequence of pseudo random. I tried "cat /dev/urandom" and got flashed with infinite pages of this :)

## 2.Python 

Learned the different ways to read an image and manpipulate it. I have got to know more about arrays, Numpy and matplotlib. 
During the process of learning this, I came across open vc and pyautogui and got ideas about image recognition using python. Took up some projects (mini games like Aim bot,memory test) based on it.


## 3.Linux and GitHub

I have had linux in my laptop for a while , but never really used it as I was more familiar with windows.
This task gave a lot of time for me to spend with Linux.

The more I use it , the more I got comfortable with it. Now i actually prefer making directories and files using the terminal than with the gui. It gave a weird feeling of coolness. 

But sometimes when you get an error ,it irritates the most. Like why is there an error before even running the code. Any how it is all good now and would definitely use Linux more often.
~~Still don't know why pip install doesent work in pycharm~~

The same with GitHub, have heard of it ,only ever used to download mods/plugins for Minecraft, but did't know what it is actually used for.

Now seeing the uses of it , I understand why open source softwares and small developers use it so much.
When I tried to push my changes into the repo,it asked for my login details and it didn't work. I got struct there for a long time, only to know that GitHub and made PAT(Personal Access Token) only through which it can be done.
Apart from this hiccup everything went smooth. Clone, add, commit, push was all done with ease
Also have planned to create and maintain a personal repo to store all my projects.

## THANK YOU
